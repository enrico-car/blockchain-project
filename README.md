## Architecture
Below is an overview of the main components required for the system to operate correctly:

- __Blockchain network__\
    Generated and managed by `Hardhat`. This is a `private PoA blockchain` that automatically creates 20 accounts. It exposes an RPC endpoint at http://localhost:8545.

- __Backend + MongoDB__\
    The backend stores selected off-chain data in clear text and provides access to the ABIs and public addresses of the deployed contracts. It is accessible at http://localhost:3000.

- __Frontend__\
    Developed with `Vue.js` and integrated with MetaMask, the frontend manages all user interactions and blockchain operations. It is served at http://localhost:5173.

- __Docker__\
    All components are containerized and orchestrated via `Docker Compose`, simplifying deployment and inter-service communication.

## Installation

### Docker
This project is fully containerized, so the only requirement is to have the latest versions of Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
All other dependencies are handled automatically within the containers.

To verify that Docker and Docker Compose are installed, run the following commands:

```bash
docker -v

docker compose version
```

If any of these commands report that a component is missing or not found, please install Docker and Docker Compose before proceeding to the execution step.

### Connect metamask to local network

To interact with the blockchain and confirm transactions, you must use the [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension.
You can install it in Firefox, Chrome, or any Chromium-based browser.

Below is a step-by-step guide to connect MetaMask to your local Hardhat blockchain and import an account:

1. Open metamask

2. In the top-left corner, click the network selector and choose Add a network manually (or Add network).

3. Fill in the network details as follows (leave the Block Explorer URL blank):

    - Network Name: Anything you want

    - New RPC URL: http://localhost:8545

    - Chain ID: 31337

    - Currency Symbol: ETH

4. Return to the main MetaMask screen and import an account.
You can paste any of the 20 private keys automatically generated by Hardhat.

Once connected and the account imported, you’ll be able to use this wallet to sign and send transactions via the web application.

## Execution

This project uses Docker Compose to orchestrate all the services. You only need two commands to start and stop everything:

To start the services:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

To stop the services and clean up:
```bash
docker compose down -v --remove-orphans
```

Always `stop the containers using the command above`.\
This ensures that all temporary volumes are properly removed. If you skip this step, leftover volumes may cause unexpected behavior the next time you start the project.

## Upgrade Cashback Contract
When the project is running, enter the Hardhat console and upgrade the new cashback contract:
```bash
docker exec -it hardhat /bin/bash

# in the hardhat docker console
npc hardhat run scripts/upgrade.js --network localhost
```

After the upgrade, in order to change the call to the new contract, modify the constant flag `IS_CASHBACK_UPGRADED` in the frontend, in the file `frontend/src/services/cashback.services.js:5` to `true`.

This will change the call to the `cashback` contract:

```js
const handlerContract = new ethers.Contract(handlerAddress, handlerAbi, signer);
const redeemTx = IS_CASHBACK_UPGRADED ? await handlerContract["redeemCashback(uint256)"](MIN_CASHBACK_AMOUNT,{gasPrice: 0 }) : await handlerContract["redeemCashback()"]({gasPrice: 0 });
```
