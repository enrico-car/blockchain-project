# Blockchain Project
As this project uses docker compose to start all the services, you simply need to type two commands in order to start and stop all the services:

To start
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

To stop
```bash
docker compose down -v --remove-orphans
```

Make sure to have installed docker compose.
